# Instructions

The Jupyter notebook `PD_Recognition_CNN.ipynb` contains a small code example of an image classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize 
different partial discharge (PD) patterns from images (e.g., internal, corona, surface/superficial). You can simply look at the outputs to get a glimpse of what
such an implementation looks like, or you can click the `Open in Colab` button at the top of the notebook to run the code yourself in Google Colab.
